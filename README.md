## Objective
A project completed using Tableau Desktop to compare the hourly wage of females and males by NAICS classifications.
The datasets were collected from Statistics Canada.

## Technologies, Tools and Methods Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau Desktop

## Analysis Summary
It can be seen that on average the maximum hourly wages for each gender have been increasing as the years increase. The rate of change of maximum hourly wages for females is higher than the male maximum hourly wage over the years. The average hourly wage also increases by $1-2 per year for each gender and approximately a $3 difference between female and male average hourly wages.

The female hourly wage comparisons organized by NAICS categories shows the highest hourly wage for females in the Utilities category and the lowest in Accomodations & Food Services category. The difference between hourly wage in 2017 and 2021 is also the largest in Utilities compared to all other categories. It can be seen that females are becoming more in demand in the Utilities category because of the large increase in the hourly wage.

The male hourly wage comparisons organized by NAICS categories shows the highest hourly wage in the Utilities category and the lowest in Accomodations & Food Services category. The difference between hourly wage in 2017 and 2021 is the largest in Information, Culture and Recreation compared to all other categories. It can be seen that males may be in more demand in the Utilities category because of the high hourly wage.

From these findings, it can be predicted that the hourly wages in the future will also increase every year for each gender. It is also seen that the hourly wages in the Utilities category is high which may show that jobs are in more demand in the Utilities category. The hourly wage in the Utilities category can be predicted to increase as the years increase because of the trend already visible in the graph. Overall, there is a small difference between hourly wages of males and females and has not yet reached an equal distribution.
